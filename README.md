# BreakingBat ðŸ¦‡
## _Another tool for pentesting Windows products and the OS itself_

### Features
- [TODO] Build as a DLL to be executed inside another process
- [TODO] The main binary is just an interpreter with special API, the scripts contain the pentest logic

### Common pentest scenarios
- Inject an image/shellcode into an existing/new process

- [TODO] Usermode WinAPI from various generic libs (**kernel32.dll**, **user32.dll**, ...)
- API from **ntdll.dll**: generic functions (available in **ntdll.lib**)
- API from **ntdll.dll**: new functions, exported only in newer Windows versions (such as `NtMapViewOfSectionEx()`)
- [TODO] RPC API: functions from RPC client libs (**winspool.drv**, ...)
