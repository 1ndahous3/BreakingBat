# Breaking Bat ðŸ¦‡

Yet another (pen)testing tool for Windows designed to implement unconventional scenarios and chain interesting methods. Cool tricks included.

### Overview

The tool consists of two parts:
1. **Core**: A `.exe` binary with low-level code and a built-in Python interpreter (runtime provides the `breaking_bat` module).
2. **Scripts**: Python scripts that leverage the `breaking_bat` module API to implement logic.

## Scripts

Example scripts can be found in the `scripts` directory, demonstrating well-known techniques.

## Core

The core implements unique concepts and techniques to enhance the tool's utility.

#### System modules

Features:
- Resolve functions and global structures of the image (retrieve RVA/offsets from PDB symbols).
- Locate RWX data caves in the `.data` section (up to the end of the page).
- Search for ROP gadgets in the `.text` section.

#### NT API

Most system APIs are called directly from **ntdll.dll**, bypassing **kernel32.dll**/**user32.dll** wrappers.

Options:
- Load a clean copy of **ntdll.dll** to avoid hooked functions.
- **[TODO]** Use direct syscalls (bypassing hooks).
- Leverage alternative APIs (e.g., `NtCreateProcess()`, `NtMapViewOfSectionEx()`), which are rarely used.

#### RPC API

By default, the core uses standard COM/RPC wrappers, but deeper options exist (avoiding hooks).

Options:
- Use RPC interfaces (including undocumented ones) via IDL-generated code.
- **[TODO]** Call functions from RPC client libraries (**winspool.drv**, etc.).
- **[TODO]** Use `NdrClientCallX()` with raw RPC structs.
- **[TODO]** Make direct ALPC calls.

#### Remote process read/write

Besides the usual scenario of allocating and writing to executable memory, there are some more interesting ones:
- Creating a shared section and mapping it into a remote process (to obtain a remote address).
- Creating a shared section and mapping it into both remote and local processes (for read/write via local address).

For read-only scenarios, the tool can create a live system dump (`NtSystemDebugControl(SysDbgGetLiveKernelDump, ...)`) and parse any process's memory.

#### Remote process execution flow and ROP gadgets

Sometimes it's possible to force remote process to call some function (to change IP), but it is not possible to pass arguments.
In some scenarios it can be bypassed via special ROP gadgets in system DLLs: they place the first args into registers (according to `__fastcall`) and jump to the address of the desired function.

Using of it requires manual stack preparation:
- Place function args (â‰¤4) + function address (for the ROP gadget).
- Place function args (>4) + shadow space + return address (for the function itself).

There are two cases, depending on what process data and what registers can be changed:
1. If it is possible to write RW data, then construct and write our part of the stack:
   - Set IP to the address of the ROP gadget.
   - Set SP to the address of the new stack (only if we do not write data to the current stack, but create a new one).
2. If it is possible to write WX code, then construct a shellcode that will construct (push on) the stack and call the ROP gadget.
   - Set IP to the address of the shellcode.

The core provides APIs to simplify stack/shellcode construction for both cases.

#### Other features

- **[TODO]** Execute commands in separate threads (bypassing thread-correlation detections). 
- **[TODO]** The core is also compiled as a DLL and embedded in the EXE (ability to drop DLL and inject it into a remote process to continue the chain).
